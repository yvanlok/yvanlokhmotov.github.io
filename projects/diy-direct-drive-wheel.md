# DIY Direct Drive Wheelbase

## Project Summary

This project showcases a fully functioning direct drive sim racing wheelbase that I designed and built from scratch. It uses a repurposed hoverboard motor to turn e waste into a high performance solution that produces around 15 Nm of sustained torque. I created the full structure, enclosure and internal layout through CAD modelling, combining aluminium extrusion with PETG printed parts that use gyroid infill for multi directional strength and improved heat resistance. The system is compact, efficient and engineered to be both serviceable and reliable.

## Technical Breakdown

- Repurposed hoverboard motor that delivers high sustained torque  
- Aluminium extrusion frame combined with custom PETG printed parts  
- CAD modelled enclosure with airflow paths for cooling  
- Off axis pulley and belt system for precise encoder reading  
- Omron style optical encoder with custom wiring and soldering  
- Open source FFBeast firmware for force feedback control  
- Planned upgrade to OpenFFBoard for deeper configurability  
- Hot swap wheel support with standard 70 mm compatibility  
- Two to three redesigns per part to improve rigidity and durability  
- Electronics mounted neatly in a compact layout

## Engineering Challenges

The project came with several constraints such as limited access to tools. Since I could not drill or machine parts, I had to redesign the motor position sensing setup using an off axis encoder arrangement. Another key challenge was achieving structural stability with printed components. Iterating through multiple prototypes taught me how to balance material choice, infill patterns, stress paths and cooling needs. The experience strengthened my understanding of how to design for stiffness and reliability when using printed parts instead of metal.

## What This Project Taught Me

This build taught me far more than how to assemble a wheelbase. It pushed me to develop skills across mechanical engineering, electronics, firmware and practical problem solving. Through the process I learned:

- How to design complex assemblies in CAD and adapt them through iterative prototyping  
- How to use materials like PETG effectively for load bearing parts  
- How to manage tolerances, clearances and mechanical alignment  
- How to work around constraints and redesign systems with creative solutions  
- How to integrate encoders, wiring, soldered connections and open source control firmware  
- How to test, evaluate and refine a system until it performs at a level comparable to commercial hardware

## Personal Impact

This project has been one of the most rewarding engineering tasks I have completed. It gave me practical experience that ties together mechanical design, electronics, firmware and simulation technology. It showed me how to turn an idea into a physical product and how to approach engineering challenges with a problem solving mindset. The final wheelbase performs at a level that rivals far more expensive commercial systems, and it represents a strong example of what can be achieved with open source tools, careful design and persistence.

## Role

I was responsible for every part of the project. This included CAD modelling, material selection, 3D printing, electronic assembly, encoder integration, firmware configuration, mechanical testing and full system validation.
